1) What is a socket?
A socket is an object in the kernel that allows the machine to communicate with other machines.
For TCP, a socket is like a pipe, except send/recieve in either direction is independent of each other
2) What is the difference between the domains AF_INET and AF_UNIX?
AF_INET will communicate with a different machine (remote host), whereas AF_UNIX is used to communicate between processes on the same machine.

3) What is the difference between SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM?
SOCK_STREAM is used by TCP; it has the "lifecycle-oriented" connection behavior. In this mode the connection will remain open until it's closed by a network error or a signal by one of the machines.

SOCK_DGRAM is a UDP connection mode wherein one datagram is sent, one reply is receieved, and then the connection closes.
4) Why is it important to clear all the values the addrinfo struct before using it in getaddrinfo?
Because otherwise the values will be used as "hints" for the getaddrinfo function to determine what type of addresses are sought.

5) What are ai_family and ai_socktype?
ai_family specifies which IP protocol the address is using (IPV4 vs IPV6)
ai_socktype species the preferred socket type

6) What does getaddrinfo do?
returns >= 1 addrinfo structures based on hints (addrinfo input) and ipv4, ipv6 addresses for the specified machine/domain.

7) What does connect do?
Connect (tcp) binds a socket to the data stream from the remote host.

8) What is setsockopt?
Allows you to manipulate socket options for a socket fd

9) What does bind do?
bind specifies which port the TCP connection (on the client) should be using

10) What does listen do?
Marks a socket as a passive socket that will accept connection requests.

11) What does accept do?
Accept gets the first connection request for the listening socket and creates a new connected socket fd.
